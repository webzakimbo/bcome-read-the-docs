Introduction
============

A Bcome installation is configured through the definition of a networks.yml configuration file, where you - 

* Declare nodes through parent-child relationships
* Declare your nodes' configuration elements, for example, your SSH architecture.

To begin, navigate to your project directory, and initialize your project using: 

.. code-block:: bash

   bcome init

For more information see: :doc:`../getting-started/setting-up-your-project`.

.. hint::

  Understand how nodes work in Bcome: :doc:`../core-concepts/nodes`.

  Your installation's architecture will be determined by how you lay out your nodes.`
