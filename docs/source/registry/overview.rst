********
Overview
********

The purpose of the Registry is to place custom method hooks directly onto your namespaces.  These method hooks are then surfaced within Bcome, and allow you to call custom functionality within the context of the namespaces associated with them.

Within any namespace in Bcome, invoke the ``registry`` method to view your available methods. For further information on commands see :doc:`../usage/executing-commands` and :doc:`../usage/command-menu`.

For configuration, see :doc:`registry-configuration-file` and :doc:`registry-configuration-attributes`.

For examples see :doc:`registry-examples`.

.. hint::

  Whilst providing convenience accessors for your orchestrative functions, adding Registry declarations is the means with which you can build up your installation into an application framework tailored to your own requirements.
