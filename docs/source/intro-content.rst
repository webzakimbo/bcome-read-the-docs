Bcome is a pure Ruby framework delivered as a rubygem_, that exposes a rapidly-deployable orchestration toolchain.  You can view the project here_ on github.

Its intention is to stop you having to re-invent the wheel with every project for the most basic of DevOps tasks:

* network discovery
* organising your network's resources in a sensible manner so that you may interact with it holistically
* working out how to access machines and bypass proxies
* writing custom orchestration
* organising the metadata you use in your orchestration, configuration management, and automation processes

Utility
^^^^^^^

Bcome allows you to give your developers the tools they need to ship their code faster:

* Share the same tools and scripts between multiple platform simultaneously
* Orchestrate all your platforms at the same time, even if they're in different networks
* Easily plug-in to your existing orchestration
* Install locally as a client-side orchestrator, or remotely as an automation agent
* Avoid duplication and stop doing the same thing over and over for each project
* Code by convention, and concentrate on functionality rather than wiring
